JIT (just-in-time) and AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation exploration via the BF (brainfuck) language.

Computation Model
=================
Computation is the execution of a sequence of steps.

Hardware can only execute a very specific set of instructions. Each machine
instruction corresponds directly to hardware execution units.

Therefore, regardless of the source language, every computation must
eventually be expressed as native machine instructions for the host.

The hardware can be considered the final layer, the layer where execution
truly happens. All other layers exist only to prepare work for this layer.

AOT pushes the computation down to this final layer before execution.
At runtime, the hardware executes the computation directly.

Interpretation keeps the computation at a higher layer. The computation exists
as a description. The hardware executes a machine that explains the
computation.

JIT moves the computation from higher layers to lower layers as it derives
information at runtime.
