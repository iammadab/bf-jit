JIT (just-in-time) and AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation exploration via the BF (brainfuck) language.

Computation Model
=================
- computation is the execution of a sequence of steps
- hardware can only execute a very specific set of instructions
- each machine instruction corresponds directly to hardware execution units
- therefore: 
  - regardless of the source language, every computation must eventually be expressed as native machine instructions for the host
