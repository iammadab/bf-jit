JIT (just-in-time) and AOT (ahead-of-time) compilation exploration via the BF (brainfuck) language.

Computation Model
=================
- computation is the execution of a sequence of steps
- hardware can only execute a very specific set of instructions
- each machine instruction corresponds directly to hardware execution units
- therefore: 
  - regardless of the source language, every computation must eventually be expressed as native machine instructions for the host
- one can consider the hardware as the final layer (the layer execution truly happens)
- AOT pushes the computation down to this layer before execution
  - at runtime, the hardware executes the computation directly
- interpretation keeps the computation at a higher layer
  - the computation exists as a description
  - the hardware executes a machine that explains the computation
- JIT moves computation to higher to lower layers, as it derives information at runtime
